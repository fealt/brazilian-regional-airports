## Project Main Objectives

```

‚ñ´Ô∏è 'What is a regional flight?' was the first question and the answer would guide an in depth
analysis on the Brazilian market.

‚ñ´Ô∏è Apply machine learning to discover clusters and group airports by international recognized
metrics.

‚ñ´Ô∏è 'Who are the airline players in the regional market?'

```

## Project Description

The capstone project for the Data Analytics Bootcamp @ironhack was free of choice! So, lucky me, I was able to combine my passion for airplanes and the aviation sector in general with all the tech skills acquired over the last six months of lessons and my personal studies. Even with the ongoing pandemic, throughout the news I noticed the growth on the aviation sector in Brazil, in particular for flights to cities never served before.

And I asked myself: "are those the regional flights"? After some research I found out that‚Äã there is no clear or even worldwide accepted definition for what is a "regional flight". So I had to define it myself based on those I could find. Check it out:

### How to classify an airport as regional?

- flights within the same state, excluding those with departure from a capital city or other major airport hubs

- flights from one state to another, excluding capital cities and other major airport hubs

## Machine Learning

Applying machine learning with cluster analysis to discover natural grouping in data.

#### Metrics:

* Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) ‚Äì A measure of an airline‚Äôs carrying capacity to generate revenue, taken from multiplying the available seats on an aircraft by the number of kilometres flown on a given flight.

* Revenue Passenger Kilometres (RPK) ‚Äì A way of calculating the number of kilometres travelled by paying customers, by multiplying the number of paying passengers by the distance travelled.

## Conclusion

* regional airports experienced a huge growth in a 15 year span ‚Äì about 500%

* one carrier player lead this growth ‚Äì 'Azul'

* several small carriers play a big role to deliver passengers to non-regional airports
